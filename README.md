# CS4244-Algebraic-Equation-Solver
For CS4244: Knowledge-Based Systems, using CLIPS System

There's two way to start our program:

1. Modify the equation in `run_equation_solver.py`. We test our program using this script.

2. Use Web User Interface
  - Install Flask: `pip install flask`
  - Launch HTTP server: `python server.py`
  - On browser, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
